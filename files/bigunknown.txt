"I create the galaxy. What's your superpower?"
"These series of works reflect my fascination for the unknown, the mystery of life and the galaxy with it's enormous force."
"It brings me comfort and strength to know that there is so much more out there then just us, the tiny human."
"The contrast in the deep colouring in my works are my interpretation of the galaxy, which POWS of the canvas."
"The colours itself almost express euphorism."
"The euphoric feeling of knowing there is so much more than us."
"All the negative thoughts fade away, just thinking about that."
